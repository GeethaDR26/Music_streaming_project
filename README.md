🎧 San’Geeth – Full Stack Music Streaming Application

San’Geeth is a full-stack music streaming web application built to understand and implement the complete flow of a real-world application — from frontend UI to backend APIs, authentication, and database integration.

This project focuses on end-to-end system understanding, not isolated features.

🚀 Project Overview

San’Geeth allows users to:

Authenticate securely using JWT

View and play songs fetched dynamically from the backend

Experience real-time data flow from MySQL → Spring Boot → React

Interact with a clean and simple music UI

The goal of this project was to simulate a production-style full-stack application, not a demo or static UI.

🧠 Key Learnings

Implementing JWT authentication end-to-end

Securing REST APIs and consuming them from a React frontend

Handling CORS, token expiration, and authorization errors

Structuring backend APIs for scalability

Managing frontend UI state during audio playback

Debugging real integration issues across layers

⚠️ Challenges Faced

JWT token handling and 401 / 403 errors

CORS issues between frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 8080)

APIs working in Postman but failing in the browser

Mapping backend JSON responses correctly to frontend components

Managing audio playback without breaking UI state

Each challenge helped deepen my understanding of how full-stack systems actually work.
